# Machine-Learning-Project

![Waldo](waldo.jpg)

For this project we will be training a neural network using Tensorflow Obeject Detection API and using a Python script built around it to find Waldo. The images used for training and testing the model were scanned from "Where's Waldo Books" found at Austin Public Library. To prepare the dataset we will create a set of labeled training images with the x-y coordinates of Waldo. The model will be configured to use with Tensorflow Object Detection API and then trained using a Python script on our dataset. To train our model we will be demonstrating our model using a web application built to allow a user to load an image and get an output with Waldo's location and also some of the additional characters.
