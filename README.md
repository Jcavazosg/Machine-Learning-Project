# Machine-Learning-Project

For this project we will be training a neural network using Tensorflow Obeject Detection API and using a Python script built around it to find Waldo. The images used for training and testing the model were scanned from "Where's Waldo Books" found at Austin's Public Library. To prepare the dataset we will create a set of labebled training images with the x y location of Waldo. The model will be configured to use with Tensorflow Obeject Detection API and then trained using a Python script on our dataset. To train our model we will be demostrating our model using a web application built to allow a user to load an image and get an output with Waldo's location and also maybe some of the additional characters.
